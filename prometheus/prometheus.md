# Prometheus

- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that helps you record real-time metrics in a time-series database. It is designed for reliability, scalability, and ease of use. Prometheus is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project and is widely used in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Prometheus collects metrics from your applications and stores them in a time-series database. It provides a powerful query language called PromQL that allows you to query and visualize your metrics. You can create custom dashboards and alerts to monitor the performance of your applications.

## Integrating Prometheus with Kubernetes:
- Prometheus can be easily integrated with Kubernetes to monitor your applications and infrastructure. You can use Prometheus to collect metrics from your Kubernetes cluster and applications, and create custom dashboards to visualize the data.
- Prometheus can be deployed as a standalone service or as part of a monitoring stack that includes Grafana for visualization and alertmanager for alerting.
- Prometheus can be used to monitor various metrics like CPU utilization, memory utilization, request latency, error rates, and more. You can create custom metrics and alerts based on your application's specific requirements.

### Steps to integrate Prometheus with Kubernetes:
1. Deploy Prometheus Operator: The Prometheus Operator is a Kubernetes operator that manages Prometheus instances and provides a declarative way to configure and manage Prometheus monitoring.
2. Configure Prometheus: You can configure Prometheus to collect metrics from your Kubernetes cluster and applications. You can define custom metrics and alerts using PromQL.
3. Deploy Grafana: Grafana is a visualization tool that allows you to create custom dashboards and graphs to visualize your metrics. You can integrate Grafana with Prometheus to create custom dashboards for your applications.
4. Configure Alertmanager: Alertmanager is a component of the Prometheus monitoring stack that handles alerts sent by Prometheus. You can configure Alertmanager to send alerts via email, Slack,Teams or other notification channels.
5. Monitor your applications: Once Prometheus is integrated with Kubernetes, you can monitor your applications and infrastructure using custom dashboards and alerts. You can create custom queries and alerts to monitor the performance of your applications.
